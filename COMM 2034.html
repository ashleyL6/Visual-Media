    <h2>Teacher</h2>
    <p>Carlos Evia</p>
  <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>Visual Media is a Communication course that focuses on four main modules: Page Layout, Photographic Composition, Video Report and Web Presence. Students will spend roughly one month on each module and will learn everything from how to use Adobe InDesign to how to shoot video with a professional camera and microphone, then code your own website to upload all of your content.</p>
  <h2>Teacher's Bio and Interests</h2>
   <p>Carlos Evia is a father to a four-year-old daughter named Sofia who takes swimming lessons at Virginia Tech and helps to grade students' video projects. He created the course called Writing and Digital Media as well, before he transferred over full time to teach in Communication instead of English.</p>
  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
   <p>This class has by far been one of the most useful for me in what I want my future career to be. I have learned how to strengthen my design skills, code a beautiful website, use professional camera equipment and produce professional-looking content in writing and videography aspects. However, for students who are taking Writing and Digital Media and Visual Media, the web presence module is very repetitive. Other than that, this class has been one of my favorites of the semester.</p>
