    <h2>Teacher</h2>
    <p>Buddy Howell</p>
  <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>The Rhetorical Tradition is a course that teaches students about the origins of communication and rhetoric. The content consists of everything from learning about Aristotle and Socrates to analyzing the bible to see if there is evidence of rhetorical strategies being used in ancient civilizations.</p>
  <h2>Teacher's Bio and Interests</h2>
   <p>Buddy Howell is one of the leading professors in the Department of Communication. He teaches the introductory course for all communication students, as well as courses in persuasion, rhetoric and propaganda. He has two teenage twins and also serves as an academic advisor for several of his students.</p>
  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
   <p>The Rhetorical Tradition is a very interesting class for people who have not already taken COMM 1014. Howell teaches both courses, and while he's one of my favorite professors, the Rhetorical Tradition has a lot of the same content that students learn in COMM 1014. However, students are not required to take the Rhetorical Tradition, so most students probably won't run into this issue. I just wish there was some more contrast between the content of both classes.</p>
