    <h2>Teacher</h2>
    <p>Kelly Scarff</p>
  <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>Technical Editing and Style is an English course where students learn how to copyedit for various types of documents for factual inconsistencies, grammatical errors, front and back matter content and both technical as well as nontechnical documents. Students will read a total of three books about editing, all of which will help students complete editing exercises in class and outside of class. </p>
  <h2>Teacher's Bio and Interests</h2>
   <p>Kelly Scarff is a graduate student who is working towards her Doctorate degree here at Virginia Tech. She was a student of Carlos Evia and works mainly in the English department. She is currently working towards becoming a full-time professor.</p>
  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
   <p>Technical Editing and Style is a tough class, but it's one that surprised me from the beginning. I have learned a ton about the Chicago Manual of Style, different types of professional documents, and how much editing can matter in the real world. I wish the course moved a little quicker, but Scarff does a wonderful job with making sure students understand the content before moving on to harder topics.</p>
  <h2>Expected Grade</h2>
   <p>I expect to earn a B+ in this class.</p>
