    <h2>Teacher</h2>
    <p>Andy Lautenschlager</p>
  <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>Writing and Digital Media has a very unique curriculum. Students begin with learning how to write and publish blog posts, how to code websites where they are expected to upload their blog posts, and then cover the topics of podcast and video production. Students will have knowledge of both CSS and HTML coding by the end of this course, and will have more experience with video and editing software than before.</p>
  <h2>Teacher's Bio and Interests</h2>
   <p>Andy Lautenschlager is a professor in the Department of English at Virginia Tech who also completed his undergraduate education here. You can often find him drinking a diet coke and listening to a good podcast. One of his favorites is the hit podcast, Serial, which details the murder of a girl in Georgia.</p>
  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
   <p>Andy Lautenschlager is one of my favorite professors I have this semester, and his class has provided me with the most tangible information I am likely to use in the field after I graduate. I really enjoyed learning how to code and make a podcast. I would advise students to put in the most effort they possibly can into this class. Not only will your grade be higher, but you're actually learning skills you will be using in the real world, so be sure to pay attention. The more effort you put in, the more benefits you'll get out of this course.</p>
  <h2>Expected Grade</h2>
    <p>I expect to earn an A- in this class.</p>
